* Each unit should only talk to its friends; don't talk to strangers
* Only talk to your immediate friends

Boy scout rule
Leave your code better than you found it

Test Driven Development (TDD)
* You may not write production code until you have written a failing unit test. 
* You may not write more of a unit test than is sufficient to fail (not-compiling is failing). 
* You may not write more production code than is sufficient to pass the currently failing test.
